They provide a nutritious meal to the children in school to attract them to school, thus, serving two purposes of curbing illiteracy and malnourishment. One nutritious meal a day brings thousands of children to school.\n \n Their goal is that no child should be deprived of education due to poverty and hunger. Undernourishment is one of the major conditions hitting the children of India., thus, Annamitra has resolved to provide good quality and hygienic food straight out of ISO certified kitchens. The food prepared is of high nutritional value, suitable for growing children. With healthy food and a full-stomach, they can concentrate better on their studies.\n \n Presently, Annamitra caters over 12,00,000 meals every day from 20 kitchen centers across 8 states. In 2016, ISKCON Food Relief Foundation was awarded the D.Y. Patil Annual Achievers Award by the Dr. D. Y. Patil Group, as the best organization for distributing midday meals to underprivileged children.",

The organisation believes that planting trees has many benefits, ranging from the power to fight pollution, strengthening the livelihood of farmers, to increasing the life expectancy of our planet.\nWith the mission to create a clean, green and healthy planet and a vision to enrich the biodiversity with lush green plants, SankalpTaru works with all their capabilities to plant as much trees as possible so that our present as well as the future generations can have a bio-diverse sustainable environment.\nSince the plantation drive is for the people, by the people, SankalpTaru uses geo-tagging and other advanced environmental techniques in order to make it easier for people to track their planted trees. The plantation drive majorly consists of four operational models, namely Rural Livelihood Support Program, Clean and Green School Program, City Based Plantation Program, and Community Land Plantation Program. All of the operational models are based on constantly escalating happy smiles through healthy trees.",

Since no one chooses to be poor, Christel House is designed to transform the lives of these impoverished children.\n \n After being a part of Christel House Learning Center, the outlook of the children coming from a weak financial background has completely changed; they are now more hygienic and enthusiastic about studies and excel not only in classroom studies but extra-curricular activities too. Christel House Learning Center is a place where children are not only fed, educated and given health care but values like respect, responsibility, integrity, a love for learning are inculcated in them to maximize their human potential.\n \n They focus on the holistic development of the child so that they can live with dignity and pride. 879 Students (5 - 18 years) are receiving free of cost quality education, medical care, and nutrition in Christel House Learning Centre as of now.",

Since no one chooses to be poor, Christel House is designed to transform the lives of these impoverished children.\n \n After being a part of Christel House Learning Center, the outlook of the children coming from a weak financial background has completely changed; they are now more hygienic and enthusiastic about studies and excel not only in classroom studies but extra-curricular activities too. Christel House Learning Center is a place where children are not only fed, educated and given health care but values like respect, responsibility, integrity, a love for learning are inculcated in them to maximize their human potential.\n \n They focus on the holistic development of the child so that they can live with dignity and pride. 879 Students (5 - 18 years) are receiving free of cost quality education, medical care, and nutrition in Christel House Learning Centre as of now.",

Women in the age group of fifty and above are the ones who suffer the most, because they are mentally and physically vulnerable.\n\nTo alleviate their suffering and bring dignity to some of these women, the Trust has opened a destitute home at Guwahati. Aptly named SENEH, meaning 'Selfless Love', the home provides shelter, food, medical care, clothing and all necessities for sustaining a decent dignified life. \n\nAs of now there are over 20 destitute women who have made SENEH their home. The extent of help that such hapless women require is evident from the fact that in the last few years SENEH has organized cataract operations, provided dentures, hearing aids, and treatments for various ailments including prolonged psychiatric medication.\n\nThe vision is that in the sunset of their lives, they can once again learn to laugh and sing and live together as a family.",

Women in the age group of fifty and above are the ones who suffer the most, because they are mentally and physically vulnerable.\n\nTo alleviate their suffering and bring dignity to some of these women, the Trust has opened a destitute home at Guwahati. Aptly named SENEH, meaning 'Selfless Love', the home provides shelter, food, medical care, clothing and all necessities for sustaining a decent dignified life. \n\nAs of now there are over 20 destitute women who have made SENEH their home. The extent of help that such hapless women require is evident from the fact that in the last few years SENEH has organized cataract operations, provided dentures, hearing aids, and treatments for various ailments including prolonged psychiatric medication.\n\nThe vision is that in the sunset of their lives, they can once again learn to laugh and sing and live together as a family.",

			"description": "\"UMMEED\" meaning hope, is a non-profit organization set up in 2001 to help children with developmental disabilities. It was set up by Dr. Vibha Krishnamurthy, Founder and Executive Director, who trained at Children's Hospital, Boston as a Developmental Pediatrician.  After returning to India, the lack of facilities for children with developmental needs led her to set up UMMEED CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER.  From an initial team size of 3, UMMEED today is an 80+ member strong professional team.\n\nUMMEED's vision is to help children with developmental disabilities and those at risk for acquiring disabilities reach their maximum potential and be integrated in society. \n\nThere are over 50 million children in India with developmental disabilities and over 650,000 in Mumbai alone. Out of these, not even a quarter have access to quality care. UMMEED addresses this mammoth issue through 4 verticals:\n*        Each year there are over 1,110 children and families supported at their clinic. \n*        UMMEED assesses and provides therapies for children with a wide range of developmental disabilities such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, Intellectual Disability, Learning Disability, Genetic Syndromes such as Down Syndrome, William Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome, Hearing Impairment. \n*        Over 60% of the children availing services at UMMEED's clinic are from low/mid socio-economic backgrounds. \n*        Ummeed also runs an Early Intervention Center (EIC), which is a mother-child program modeled on the pre-school model, where children between the ages of 2-6 years are trained on communication skills, play skills, social interaction, etc. with the objective of getting them school ready. \n\nUmmeed is one of the five centers in India approved for providing a recognized Fellowship program in Developmental Pediatrics, the IAP Fellowship in Developmental Pediatrics. \n\nTraining (Center for influence): \nIn January 2017, Ummeed set up a dedicated training facility to extend its reach to at-risk and undiagnosed children in the community. They do this through training professionals, parents, teachers, community workers and partner organizations in a range of various disciplines in the child development & disability space.\n\n\nResearch:\nUmmeed participated in a five-year four-country research project funded by the National Institutes of health, USA and in partnership with Yale University and the University of Ankara, to develop and test a tool to monitor and support Early Childhood Development specifically for use in low and middle-income countries. This tool is now used in Ummeed's community programs to monitor child development. \n\nThe findings of this research have recently been published in the Lancet, one of the most prestigious peer reviewed medical journals. \n\nAdvocacy: \n*        Ummeed is constantly working to better the lives of children with disabilities. Towards this, Ummeed is a member of the National Trust, the disability committee of the WHO, the Rehabilitation Council of India, Action for Autism, and is also part of the task force for the implementation of the Right to education Act. Ummeed personnel also serve as experts on the committee formed for the implementation of the Rashtriya Bal Swasthiya Karyakram of the Government of India.\n\nUMMEED has reached out to over 16 Government special schools, trained 80 teachers in these schools working with over 4000 children through the school outreach programme.",

It was set up by Dr. Vibha Krishnamurthy, Founder and Executive Director, who trained at Children's Hospital, Boston as a Developmental Pediatrician.  After returning to India, the lack of facilities for children with developmental needs led her to set up UMMEED CHILD DEVELOPMENT CENTER.  From an initial team size of 3, UMMEED today is an 80+ member strong professional team.\n\nUMMEED's vision is to help children with developmental disabilities and those at risk for acquiring disabilities reach their maximum potential and be integrated in society. \n\nThere are over 50 million children in India with developmental disabilities and over 650,000 in Mumbai alone. Out of these, not even a quarter have access to quality care. UMMEED addresses this mammoth issue through 4 verticals:\n*        Each year there are over 1,110 children and families supported at their clinic. \n*        UMMEED assesses and provides therapies for children with a wide range of developmental disabilities such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, Intellectual Disability, Learning Disability, Genetic Syndromes such as Down Syndrome, William Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome, Hearing Impairment. \n*        Over 60% of the children availing services at UMMEED's clinic are from low/mid socio-economic backgrounds. \n*        Ummeed also runs an Early Intervention Center (EIC), which is a mother-child program modeled on the pre-school model, where children between the ages of 2-6 years are trained on communication skills, play skills, social interaction, etc. with the objective of getting them school ready. \n\nUmmeed is one of the five centers in India approved for providing a recognized Fellowship program in Developmental Pediatrics, the IAP Fellowship in Developmental Pediatrics. \n\nTraining (Center for influence): \nIn January 2017, Ummeed set up a dedicated training facility to extend its reach to at-risk and undiagnosed children in the community. They do this through training professionals, parents, teachers, community workers and partner organizations in a range of various disciplines in the child development & disability space.\n\n\nResearch:\nUmmeed participated in a five-year four-country research project funded by the National Institutes of health, USA and in partnership with Yale University and the University of Ankara, to develop and test a tool to monitor and support Early Childhood Development specifically for use in low and middle-income countries. This tool is now used in Ummeed's community programs to monitor child development. \n\nThe findings of this research have recently been published in the Lancet, one of the most prestigious peer reviewed medical journals. \n\nAdvocacy: \n*        Ummeed is constantly working to better the lives of children with disabilities. Towards this, Ummeed is a member of the National Trust, the disability committee of the WHO, the Rehabilitation Council of India, Action for Autism, and is also part of the task force for the implementation of the Right to education Act. Ummeed personnel also serve as experts on the committee formed for the implementation of the Rashtriya Bal Swasthiya Karyakram of the Government of India.\n\nUMMEED has reached out to over 16 Government special schools, trained 80 teachers in these schools working with over 4000 children through the school outreach programme.",

			"description": "City life seem alluring to many, especially the young. It is estimated that in Hyderabad and Secunderabad alone there are about 60000 street or working children. On an average, 70-80 children stray into the cities daily. They live on streets, railway platforms, bus stations and in unhygienic, disease-infested slums. \n\nDon Bosco Navajeevan (DBNJ) has street educators located in hot spots to offer continuous support to children on the street through a unique approach called Street Presence. They are 'present' round-the-clock at various strategic locations where children enter the city, live or work. They work closely with the Police, APSRTC and Railway Staff. Child Rescue Booths set up by them help rescue children who run away from home and protect them from any form of abuse. \n\nThe strategy that evolved from Navajeevan's experience at Vijayawada is to first speak to the children and gain their confidence and trust. A Street Presence Team, constituted of six street educators, is set up.  The team contacts street children and builds a good rapport with them. During the past 11 years, they have contacted more than 28000 children in and around Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Kachiguda Railway Stations that have got the highest level of concentration of street children. The team has placed more than 9500 children back at their homes after due counselling. They also arranged better job placements for more than 440 boys.",

On an average, 70-80 children stray into the cities daily. They live on streets, railway platforms, bus stations and in unhygienic, disease-infested slums. \n\nDon Bosco Navajeevan (DBNJ) has street educators located in hot spots to offer continuous support to children on the street through a unique approach called Street Presence. They are 'present' round-the-clock at various strategic locations where children enter the city, live or work. They work closely with the Police, APSRTC and Railway Staff. Child Rescue Booths set up by them help rescue children who run away from home and protect them from any form of abuse. \n\nThe strategy that evolved from Navajeevan's experience at Vijayawada is to first speak to the children and gain their confidence and trust. A Street Presence Team, constituted of six street educators, is set up.  The team contacts street children and builds a good rapport with them. During the past 11 years, they have contacted more than 28000 children in and around Secunderabad, Hyderabad and Kachiguda Railway Stations that have got the highest level of concentration of street children. The team has placed more than 9500 children back at their homes after due counselling. They also arranged better job placements for more than 440 boys.",

They also approach through word of mouth referrals, website and through social media. \n\nOver 80% of the patients are from the lower income group. With no financial means, terminal illnesses like cancer leaves them traumatised both physically and mentally. Cancer patients form about 78% of the total patients treated.\n\nThe organisation primarily works in the area of pain relief. Once diagnosed with terminal illness, treatments are gradually stopped and patients are only left with pain management during the rest of their lives. This involves both medicines that are ingested as well as periodic change in dressing of the tumours. The family members of the patients are also trained to nurse the patients and administer the medicines as required. \n\nThere are two forms of services - Out-patient services and Home Based Care. Out-patient care is for patients who are able to come to the office or have family members who are mobile. Home Based Care is primarily for patients who are immobile. In addition to this they also work with the Department of health & Family Welfare and State health Society, Govt. of Tamil Nadu actively to provide training and create awareness.",

With no financial means, terminal illnesses like cancer leaves them traumatised both physically and mentally. Cancer patients form about 78% of the total patients treated.\n\nThe organisation primarily works in the area of pain relief. Once diagnosed with terminal illness, treatments are gradually stopped and patients are only left with pain management during the rest of their lives. This involves both medicines that are ingested as well as periodic change in dressing of the tumours. The family members of the patients are also trained to nurse the patients and administer the medicines as required. \n\nThere are two forms of services - Out-patient services and Home Based Care. Out-patient care is for patients who are able to come to the office or have family members who are mobile. Home Based Care is primarily for patients who are immobile. In addition to this they also work with the Department of health & Family Welfare and State health Society, Govt. of Tamil Nadu actively to provide training and create awareness.",

As she thought through the solution, she believed that the answer lay in a people's movement that needed to come together to provide every child in India an excellent education. \n\nIn 2007, Shaheen met with Wendy Kopp, the Founder of Teach For America and was struck by the idea of leadership being at the core of the solution. In 2009, Teach For India welcomed our first cohort, the Class of 2009, to the Fellowship. The 87 \"niners\" formed the beginning of what Shaheen hoped would become a nationwide movement of diverse leaders. \n\nIn 2011, their Niners graduated from the Fellowship and became the first cohort in their Alumni movement. Through their work as Alumni, the hope was that they would become lifelong leaders for equity. Their first cohort of Alumni went into teaching, teacher training, school leadership, and government policy. \n\nToday, they have 1145 Fellows working relentlessly in the short-term to change the lives of 40,075 students in their classrooms and become leaders for change themselves. And they have 2581 Alumni who are collectively fuelling the larger movement towards our vision. The problem of educational inequity cannot be solved alone. Their story is in the relentless efforts of their fellows, alumni, staff, partners and supporters, and their children. Together, they believe that we can redraw India to be the country we want it to be.",

			"description": "Maria Seva Sangha (M.S.S) is a charitable society registered under Section 12A of the Indian Income Tax Act. Maria Seva Sangha was established in 1981 to undertake educational, medical, housing and other social activities in aid of the poor and the underprivileged of all ages, irrespective of caste, creed, and community.\n\nThe initial seeds of Maria Seva Sangha was planted by Ms. Ethel Brito, a prominent social worker. Back in the 1970s, Ms. Brito was strongly concerned by the poor quality of life of the weaker sections of society in Bangalore. Her dream of improving the plight of the underprivileged began to grow and in 1981, the Maria Seva Sangha was born, to cater to their needs.\n\nSome of the issues that Ms. Brito felt strongly about inlcuded:\n\n\nPoor, deserving students not being able to pursue higher studies due to financial constraints.\nHundreds of poverty stricken children attending school on empty stomachs.\nShortage of housing for battered women, widows and low income group families.\nLarge numbers of elderly people desperately wanting care and shelter.\n\nIn 1981, Ms. Brito, along with a group of like-minded, public-spirited people, set up a voluntary organization and they called it, Maria Seva Sangha. They worked together to obtain registration, tax-exemption, FCRA sanction and the like, to establish the institution's credentials in the eyes of the public. Several projects were launched to support economically deprived children, widows, families and elders, through a strong financial base slowly built up by the generosity and goodwill of donors.\n\nHowever, following prolonged litigation, spanning over one-and-a-half decades, related to the eviction of tenants and settlement of claims on properties bequeathed to MSS, the Sangha's resources were severely depleted. \n\nWith good support from donors and the public, on closure of these issues, the Sangha has been able to embark whole-heartedly on two new projects, the Senior Citizens Home and the development of apartment buildings and residential sites for the underprivileged- Mathrudhan- at Krishnarajapuram .\n\nThe Midday Meal Scheme for underpriviledged children commenced in 1987. It aims to improve attendance in schools along with the health of the children and their performance in studies. The incentive of free midday meals pulled children from slum areas into schools thus avoiding them getting involved in theft, drugs prostitution, etc.\n\nThey currently aid 21 schools in Bangalore Urban and Bangalore Rural.  The monitoring of meals effectiveness is done by Maria Seva Sangha aided by St.Anne's Women's Degree College, Ulsoor.\n\nOver the past 37 years, the dream of one lady has become a reality, benefiting thousands of poor and needy persons and has given the members of the MSS great personal satisfaction for their selfless service.",

Maria Seva Sangha was established in 1981 to undertake educational, medical, housing and other social activities in aid of the poor and the underprivileged of all ages, irrespective of caste, creed, and community.\n\nThe initial seeds of Maria Seva Sangha was planted by Ms. Ethel Brito, a prominent social worker. Back in the 1970s, Ms. Brito was strongly concerned by the poor quality of life of the weaker sections of society in Bangalore. Her dream of improving the plight of the underprivileged began to grow and in 1981, the Maria Seva Sangha was born, to cater to their needs.\n\nSome of the issues that Ms. Brito felt strongly about inlcuded:\n\n\nPoor, deserving students not being able to pursue higher studies due to financial constraints.\nHundreds of poverty stricken children attending school on empty stomachs.\nShortage of housing for battered women, widows and low income group families.\nLarge numbers of elderly people desperately wanting care and shelter.\n\nIn 1981, Ms. Brito, along with a group of like-minded, public-spirited people, set up a voluntary organization and they called it, Maria Seva Sangha. They worked together to obtain registration, tax-exemption, FCRA sanction and the like, to establish the institution's credentials in the eyes of the public. Several projects were launched to support economically deprived children, widows, families and elders, through a strong financial base slowly built up by the generosity and goodwill of donors.\n\nHowever, following prolonged litigation, spanning over one-and-a-half decades, related to the eviction of tenants and settlement of claims on properties bequeathed to MSS, the Sangha's resources were severely depleted. \n\nWith good support from donors and the public, on closure of these issues, the Sangha has been able to embark whole-heartedly on two new projects, the Senior Citizens Home and the development of apartment buildings and residential sites for the underprivileged- Mathrudhan- at Krishnarajapuram .\n\nThe Midday Meal Scheme for underpriviledged children commenced in 1987. It aims to improve attendance in schools along with the health of the children and their performance in studies. The incentive of free midday meals pulled children from slum areas into schools thus avoiding them getting involved in theft, drugs prostitution, etc.\n\nThey currently aid 21 schools in Bangalore Urban and Bangalore Rural.  The monitoring of meals effectiveness is done by Maria Seva Sangha aided by St.Anne's Women's Degree College, Ulsoor.\n\nOver the past 37 years, the dream of one lady has become a reality, benefiting thousands of poor and needy persons and has given the members of the MSS great personal satisfaction for their selfless service.",

Their diligent efforts on more than 20 projects with support from national and international partners have resulted in the assured water supply to 42,000 people for domestic requirements and irrigation to a land of 13,000 hectares. These accomplishments resulted in an increase in the number of girl students attending schools and a considerable decrease in the number of cases of genito-urinary infections among other ailments. \n \n With other projects on natural resources' management; water and sanitation; health and livelihood opportunities - members of Haritika aim at a just, enlightened, healthy and democratic Bundelkhand, free of hunger, poverty, environmental degradation and all forms of exploitation irrespective of age, sex, religion, and ethnicity.",

It is an NGO that now provides services to the underprivileged children of Delhi and the neighboring regions to promote their health, development, economic and social wellbeing.\n \n The most well-known programme of DCCW is Palna, home for the abandoned, homeless and destitute children. At Palna, infants arrive in a precarious state of health and the best possible medical care is given to them. It is a home to those children whose parents relinquish them or surrendered to them by the Police. DCCW works towards creating awareness on matters of basic health and hygiene, nutrition, pre-natal and post-natal maternal and childcare to the women in rural areas and urban slums. They also conduct programmes aimed at the education of children from underprivileged families.\n \n The Orthopaedic Centre set by DCCW provides a complete range of rehabilitation services to physically disabled children, especially those affected by polio. More than 9,000 surgeries have been performed up to date and 25000 children have been fitted with polio aids. Their mission is to give every child the childhood they deserve.",

It is an NGO that now provides services to the underprivileged children of Delhi and the neighboring regions to promote their health, development, economic and social wellbeing.\n \n The most well-known programme of DCCW is Palna, home for the abandoned, homeless and destitute children. At Palna, infants arrive in a precarious state of health and the best possible medical care is given to them. It is a home to those children whose parents relinquish them or surrendered to them by the Police. DCCW works towards creating awareness on matters of basic health and hygiene, nutrition, pre-natal and post-natal maternal and childcare to the women in rural areas and urban slums. They also conduct programmes aimed at the education of children from underprivileged families.\n \n The Orthopaedic Centre set by DCCW provides a complete range of rehabilitation services to physically disabled children, especially those affected by polio. More than 9,000 surgeries have been performed up to date and 25000 children have been fitted with polio aids. Their mission is to give every child the childhood they deserve.",

			"description": "Sahyog is a committed NGO working towards the empowerment of slum dwellers. It was started in 2002 with the vision to bring smiles in the lives of underprivileged people. The word \"Sahyog\" beckons cooperation; to walk in cooperation with each other is what Sahyog is all about. Sahyog gives its Sahyog in providing quality education to slum children with an aim to facilitate their all round development and finally to mainstream these children into government schools. \n\nSahyog is all about working in synergy with all the stakeholders of our community. Shekhar, the founder of Sahyog, happened to chance upon two small children working in a tea shop instead of attending school. This motivated him and a group of people sharing his dream to help children, start Sahyog.\n\nThe programme began with five students which has now risen to 1850 students in 21 centres and 750 women in Adult literacy centers in Sultanpuri, Mangolpuri, Shakti Nagar, Nihal Vihar, Burari, Moti Nagar, Bawana, Budh Vihar, Gulabi Bagh, R.P Bagh. Delhi and NCR. \n\nStudents are provided adequate infrastructure and regular support from teachers to prevent their dropout rate from school. The organisation is also flexible about supporting various other campaigns such as organising health camps, supporting the cause of women, destitute old people and so on. Till date, the organisation has been running with the help of cooperation extended by their team members, friends and relatives. \n\nDue to the happiness and response that they received from the beneficiaries, they long to spread our arms to reach out to more people. They need help in their mission to reach out to a minimum of 5000 underprivileged students within next two years. Every Sahyog you make will bring smiles to thousand.",

The word \"Sahyog\" beckons cooperation; to walk in cooperation with each other is what Sahyog is all about. Sahyog gives its Sahyog in providing quality education to slum children with an aim to facilitate their all round development and finally to mainstream these children into government schools. \n\nSahyog is all about working in synergy with all the stakeholders of our community. Shekhar, the founder of Sahyog, happened to chance upon two small children working in a tea shop instead of attending school. This motivated him and a group of people sharing his dream to help children, start Sahyog.\n\nThe programme began with five students which has now risen to 1850 students in 21 centres and 750 women in Adult literacy centers in Sultanpuri, Mangolpuri, Shakti Nagar, Nihal Vihar, Burari, Moti Nagar, Bawana, Budh Vihar, Gulabi Bagh, R.P Bagh. Delhi and NCR. \n\nStudents are provided adequate infrastructure and regular support from teachers to prevent their dropout rate from school. The organisation is also flexible about supporting various other campaigns such as organising health camps, supporting the cause of women, destitute old people and so on. Till date, the organisation has been running with the help of cooperation extended by their team members, friends and relatives. \n\nDue to the happiness and response that they received from the beneficiaries, they long to spread our arms to reach out to more people. They need help in their mission to reach out to a minimum of 5000 underprivileged students within next two years. Every Sahyog you make will bring smiles to thousand.",

They also provide relief and rehabilitation to victims of disaster and train them on disaster preparedness.\n\nSPPD envisions a secure & sustainable community with special focus on empowering vulnerable groups through 5 broad thematic areas. education & skill development focuses on providing wholesome education to children and demand-driven skill training to youth. They also prioritise health which is central to human well being.\n\nProviding the children living with HIV/AIDS with monthly nutritional kit is one of other important activities. Their intervention with women groups is through building their capacity to become self reliant. India is primarily an agrarian country and hence SPPD strongly believes in reviving agriculture and making it profitable and sustainable.\n\nThis would solve many of the socio-economic issues that the rural population faces. The organization has trained small & marginal farmers in sustainable agriculture and has demonstrated the scope of dry land farming in a semi-arid region by establishing a model farm cum training centre. Yet another major initiative for Organic farming practices of SPPD is the propagation of preserved green fodder among the farmers of these drought prone districts. Disaster relief, rehabilitation, and more importantly training on Disaster Preparedness forms a part of interventions of SPPD.\n\nToday, SPPD has been executing projects in partnership with the state government, central government, corporate, Not-for-profit organizations and individual philanthropists from India & abroad. The organisation has an impeccable track record of executing several projects which has transformed thousands of lives and stands testimony to the organisation's commitment & expertise.

They also prioritise health which is central to human well being.\n\nProviding the children living with HIV/AIDS with monthly nutritional kit is one of other important activities. Their intervention with women groups is through building their capacity to become self reliant. India is primarily an agrarian country and hence SPPD strongly believes in reviving agriculture and making it profitable and sustainable.\n\nThis would solve many of the socio-economic issues that the rural population faces. The organization has trained small & marginal farmers in sustainable agriculture and has demonstrated the scope of dry land farming in a semi-arid region by establishing a model farm cum training centre. Yet another major initiative for Organic farming practices of SPPD is the propagation of preserved green fodder among the farmers of these drought prone districts. Disaster relief, rehabilitation, and more importantly training on Disaster Preparedness forms a part of interventions of SPPD.\n\nToday, SPPD has been executing projects in partnership with the state government, central government, corporate, Not-for-profit organizations and individual philanthropists from India & abroad. The organisation has an impeccable track record of executing several projects which has transformed thousands of lives and stands testimony to the organisation's commitment & expertise. The organization has been enlisted by Global Giving - U.S, U.K and GiveIndia, TATA power and Your Cause that demonstrates its credibility, transparency and management.",

Additionally, they achieved the Rajasthan Government's appreciation of Rastriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram for providing advanced treatment to needy sick children. \n \n GHRCs tremendous efforts have built a strong bridge to realizing their mission to provide world-class complete healthcare services, responsibly and with a human touch at affordable prices.",

They further extended support to women and child victims of sexual violence as well as sexual harassment at the workplace.\n\nThey are also involved in training, research, campaigns, and publications on issues concerning violence against women and children. They work to demystify laws and make them accessible to judges, lawyers, prosecutors, police, NGOs and other government and non-government representatives and most importantly, to women themselves. \n\nThe broad categories of their programs are as follows:\nLitigation\nRahat (for sexual violence, domestic violence, and social support)\nTraining and Awareness\nPolicy interventions and public campaigns\nNetworking\nPublications on women's legal rights and Research",

			"description": "SBT aims to provide a sensitive and caring environment to street & working children and other children on the margins of society. It seeks to dissolve the barriers that rob children of the opportunity to realize their rights. \n\nIn the 1980s, the making of Mira Nair's 'Salaam Bombay' (award winning film) revealed the dark underbelly of Mumbai's streets, where several childhoods were at stake. A combination of socio-economic exigencies, political circumstances and parent's struggle for survival created a large population of children, living and working on the streets of India. As all across the country street children, an invisible section of the society, continued an invisible struggle on the streets of Delhi too. In the day time, children grapple with the challenges of street life.\n\nWhen night falls, they curl up in crevices - at the end of the platform, under a staircase, in the subway - where the possibility of security exists. Ms Praveen Nair, Chairperson and Trustee at Salaam Baalak Trust testifies: It took us quite a while to break the ice with the boys. Sanjoy (Roy) and myself would scout the railway platforms every day, chat with the boys...however they had been cheated time and again, and we weren't the first to propose help. So they would laugh off our intentions but we never gave up.Finally when we answered their urgent call for help to care for a terribly sick boy, a friend of theirs, began the never-ending bond.\" \n\nSpending quality time with these children, the founding members of the Trust realised that while most of these children were forced into these circumstances, many of them had chosen this life; what set them apart, was their chutzpah, their spirit. Ms Nair adds: \"We started with the idea of donating blankets to the children in the bitter winter cold. We started at the very place where GRP centre now stands. However, we proved naAve about their actual needs. The children told us that sleeping under a blanket invited sexual attentions from older children. They stuffed newspapers and wore layers of clothing (all the clothes they possessed, actually) this not only kept them warm but also kept the clothes from being stolen! That's when we realised children needed a roof over their heads and safe spaces.\"\n\nFrom three staff and 25 children on a balcony of the Ground Reserve Police at the New Delhi Railway station more than 29 years ago, we have now grown to over 200 staff, providing support services for over 9,000 children a year in Delhi & the NCR region through our 22 centers. Over the years, Salaam Baalak Trust has successfully worked with over 81,000 children; significant numbers have been restored to their families.\n\nThey have 2 children who have completed their engineering and one boy who is currently pursuing engineering, 3 who have completed their Masters in Arts programme, 9 who have won scholarships for advanced programmes to American Universities, 43 children in various graduation programmes sponsored by an Australian University, and many more who are pursuing their academic career in schools and colleges across India.",

That's when we realised children needed a roof over their heads and safe spaces.\"\n\nFrom three staff and 25 children on a balcony of the Ground Reserve Police at the New Delhi Railway station more than 29 years ago, we have now grown to over 200 staff, providing support services for over 9,000 children a year in Delhi & the NCR region through our 22 centers. Over the years, Salaam Baalak Trust has successfully worked with over 81,000 children; significant numbers have been restored to their families.\n\nThey have 2 children who have completed their engineering and one boy who is currently pursuing engineering, 3 who have completed their Masters in Arts programme, 9 who have won scholarships for advanced programmes to American Universities, 43 children in various graduation programmes sponsored by an Australian University, and many more who are pursuing their academic career in schools and colleges across India.",

			"description": "In 1992, an organization called Prerana had been working with farmers in North Karnataka's Raichur district. Prerana offered its office as a shelter for children, who were mostly living on Raichur railway station.\n\nOver the next 3 to 4 years, the activities with the children expanded and recreational activities were included such as picnics, skill training programs like cycle-repair, screen printing and so on. Although the attempts to place them in jobs met limited success, the engagement with children continued. After a family adopted one child, they realized that many of these children were not abandoned by their families, but had opted to 'flee' because of certain reasons (which in most cases were not very serious) without actually thinking of the consequences.\n\nThe concept of 'restoration' or 'home-placement' of children thus began to take shape. Ground research revealed that the parents are also distraught when the child leaves; and they often attempt to search the child without any leads. There was a zeal within the team members to work on this issue in a dedicated manner and a new organization was carved out of Prerana. SATHI was born.\n\nFounded in 1992, SATHI was formally registered in 1997 in Raichur, Karnataka. With the growth of the organization and expansion of work, SATHI moved its head office to Bangalore. Over the years, SATHI has worked in more than 40 different locations in 14 states across India and has helped nearly 60,000 children reunite with their families.\n\nPassionate about children and their well-being, Pramod Kulkarni founded SATHI with an initial focus on providing immediate care and opportunities of resettlement for run-away children. Experience and research convinced him that run-away children could be settled back with families. An action-oriented individual, he decided to demonstrate this possibility - in large numbers and at a national scale.\n\nSATHI continued to work with Raichur as a base until the year 2000. During this phase, the work was restricted to Raichur and Wadi in Karnataka and Guntakal in Andhra Pradesh. From 2000 to 2006, the work expanded to cover other locations in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. The year 2000 also marked the beginning of SATHI's work in Government Children Homes.\n\n\nThe year 2006 marked a new phase in SATHI's history, when it began to expand its geographical spread across the country through collaborations with other NGOs. Between 2006 and 2010, SATHI collaborated with more than 30 different organizations and covered railway stations in 10 states including Gujarat, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh.",

			"description": "Founded in 1993, The Tamilnad Kidney Research Foundation was set up primarily to provide financial assistance to underprivileged patients for dialysis, transplantation, investigation and medication costs. The Foundation also aims to encourage organ donation at the time of death. TANKER was started by Dr. Georgi Abraham along with a group of like-minded individuals. From providing financial assistance to needy patients and spreading awareness to providing subsidized and free dialysis, TANKER has taken every effort to live up to its vision. It currently provides services in the following areas:\n\nDialysis: A person suffering from kidney failure can survive only when he/she undergoes dialysis or a kidney transplantation. Haemodialysis involves the use of an artificial kidney termed \"Dialyser\", which emulates the functions of a normal kidney. It needs to be done 2-3 times a week and is an expensive process. TANKER Foundation has made dialysis affordable for economically backward sections using their Subsidised Units. Dialysis in a private hospital costs anywhere between Rs 1500 to Rs. 2500. At TANKER, dialysis is offered either free or at a subsidised rate of Rs. 375 to patients. It costs TANKER Rs.1100 for every dialysis. The shortfall of Rs.725 is covered by donations from well wishers. Presently 377 patients benefit from this every month.\n\nFistula- An A V fistula is essential for dialysis. This is created surgically by joining a vein to an artery in the area of the wrist. Impure blood is first drawn from the fistula on the patient's wrist, passed through the dialyser machine and clean blood is returned to the patient. A Fistula surgery costs between Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 15,000/-, which is beyond what many patients can afford. \n\nFinancial Support- The Foundation helps needy patients from all over India by offering them one-time contributions ranging from Rs.1,500/- to Rs.20,000/- towards transplantation, investigation and post-transplantation medication costs. \n\nResearch grants- The importance of advances in Kidney research is recognised by TANKER. Funding is provided to research projects for studies in various aspects of kidney disease. \n\nInternships and training- TANKER at its various dialysis units provides training and internship for budding nurses, lab technicians and those looking at Administrative roles. The Foundation is also a training ground for students of Social Work, Public Relations and Sociology.\n\nOrgan Donation- TANKER encourages deceased-donor organ donation that can be a boon for not just kidney patients but also for others suffering from life threatening ailments. Deceased-donor organ donation is not very popular in our country and hence the recipient waiting lists are long.\nDeceased-donor organ donation consists of removing viable organs from brain dead donors and then transplanting them into a living patient who needs it. Soon after a patient is declared brain dead (the patient is dead but the heart maintains circulation usually with mechanical ventilation support), the organs are harvested. The harvested organs are then kept cold to delay the natural decaying process. These are then transplanted to the needy patient.\n\nTANKER under the Deceased-Donor Transplantation Programme, sponsored a meeting of surgeons and physicians in October, 2005. Their recommendation to the health Secretary resulted in the expansion of the panel of specialists who certify brain-stem death. The TANKER Trustee Doctors were part of the team that performed the first government approved multi organ deceased-donor transplant in December 1995. TANKER also supports MOHAN (Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network) Foundation in creating awareness about deceased-donor organ donation.",

						"profile": "Founded in 1993, The Tamilnad Kidney Research Foundation was set up primarily to provide financial assistance to underprivileged patients for dialysis, transplantation, investigation and medication costs. The Foundation also aims to encourage organ donation at the time of death. TANKER was started by Dr. Georgi Abraham along with a group of like-minded individuals. From providing financial assistance to needy patients and spreading awareness to providing subsidized and free dialysis, TANKER has taken every effort to live up to its vision. It currently provides services in the following areas:\n\nDialysis: A person suffering from kidney failure can survive only when he/she undergoes dialysis or a kidney transplantation. Haemodialysis involves the use of an artificial kidney termed \"Dialyser\", which emulates the functions of a normal kidney. It needs to be done 2-3 times a week and is an expensive process. TANKER Foundation has made dialysis affordable for economically backward sections using their Subsidised Units. Dialysis in a private hospital costs anywhere between Rs 1500 to Rs. 2500. At TANKER, dialysis is offered either free or at a subsidised rate of Rs. 375 to patients. It costs TANKER Rs.1100 for every dialysis. The shortfall of Rs.725 is covered by donations from well wishers. Presently 377 patients benefit from this every month.\n\nFistula- An A V fistula is essential for dialysis. This is created surgically by joining a vein to an artery in the area of the wrist. Impure blood is first drawn from the fistula on the patient's wrist, passed through the dialyser machine and clean blood is returned to the patient. A Fistula surgery costs between Rs. 10,000/- to Rs. 15,000/-, which is beyond what many patients can afford. \n\nFinancial Support- The Foundation helps needy patients from all over India by offering them one-time contributions ranging from Rs.1,500/- to Rs.20,000/- towards transplantation, investigation and post-transplantation medication costs. \n\nResearch grants- The importance of advances in Kidney research is recognised by TANKER. Funding is provided to research projects for studies in various aspects of kidney disease. \n\nInternships and training- TANKER at its various dialysis units provides training and internship for budding nurses, lab technicians and those looking at Administrative roles. The Foundation is also a training ground for students of Social Work, Public Relations and Sociology.\n\nOrgan Donation- TANKER encourages deceased-donor organ donation that can be a boon for not just kidney patients but also for others suffering from life threatening ailments. Deceased-donor organ donation is not very popular in our country and hence the recipient waiting lists are long.\nDeceased-donor organ donation consists of removing viable organs from brain dead donors and then transplanting them into a living patient who needs it. Soon after a patient is declared brain dead (the patient is dead but the heart maintains circulation usually with mechanical ventilation support), the organs are harvested. The harvested organs are then kept cold to delay the natural decaying process. These are then transplanted to the needy patient.\n\nTANKER under the Deceased-Donor Transplantation Programme, sponsored a meeting of surgeons and physicians in October, 2005. Their recommendation to the health Secretary resulted in the expansion of the panel of specialists who certify brain-stem death. The TANKER Trustee Doctors were part of the team that performed the first government approved multi organ deceased-donor transplant in December 1995. TANKER also supports MOHAN (Multi Organ Harvesting Aid Network) Foundation in creating awareness about deceased-donor organ donation.",

The organization also conducts reading and overall development classes for children from underprivileged families.

The organisation caters to 1500+ children across 4 centres in Noida and 1 in Siwan, Bihar.\n\nVidya & Child started its activities by supporting the education of 2 children of domestic servants. Both performed exceptionally in their classes. This reinforced the belief that given the right atmosphere and opportunity all children can excel despite their background and challenges.\n\nMs Supriya Akhaury, a qualified Chartered Accountant, left her practice in 1998 to start Vidya & Child with just 2 children. Today after 19 years, Vidya & Child reaches out to over 1600+ children. This would not have been possible without her passion and commitment towards her chosen cause.\n\nThe organisation caters to children from Nursery to Class XII & beyond. Most of the children are first generation learners and have parents who work as domestic servants, rickshaw pullers, industrial workers, plumbers & street vendors.\n\nVidya & Child offers a holistic approach through intensive Life Skills and Arts & Performing Arts along with academic, financial & mentoring support. \n\nNo of children in After School Support Programme - 217\nNo of children in NIOS Programme - 72\nNo of children in School Programme - 1150\nNo of children in Life Skills Programme - 1600\nNo of children in Foundation Programme - 128\nNo of children in APA Programme -1400\n\nAccording to Supriya, Vidya & Child is an opportunity for every child to complete school education within the mainstream, understand his or her own self, to be able to overcome challenges, and be helped in understanding what his/her creative strengths are, all of which ensures that each child carves out a more meaningful life for himself or herself.",

The organisation caters to 1500+ children across 4 centres in Noida and 1 in Siwan, Bihar.\n\nVidya & Child started its activities by supporting the education of 2 children of domestic servants. Both performed exceptionally in their classes. This reinforced the belief that given the right atmosphere and opportunity all children can excel despite their background and challenges.\n\nMs Supriya Akhaury, a qualified Chartered Accountant, left her practice in 1998 to start Vidya & Child with just 2 children. Today after 19 years, Vidya & Child reaches out to over 1600+ children. This would not have been possible without her passion and commitment towards her chosen cause.\n\nThe organisation caters to children from Nursery to Class XII & beyond. Most of the children are first generation learners and have parents who work as domestic servants, rickshaw pullers, industrial workers, plumbers & street vendors.\n\nVidya & Child offers a holistic approach through intensive Life Skills and Arts & Performing Arts along with academic, financial & mentoring support. \n\nNo of children in After School Support Programme - 217\nNo of children in NIOS Programme - 72\nNo of children in School Programme - 1150\nNo of children in Life Skills Programme - 1600\nNo of children in Foundation Programme - 128\nNo of children in APA Programme -1400\n\nAccording to Supriya, Vidya & Child is an opportunity for every child to complete school education within the mainstream, understand his or her own self, to be able to overcome challenges, and be helped in understanding what his/her creative strengths are, all of which ensures that each child carves out a more meaningful life for himself or herself.",

			"description": "Sant Singaji Educational Society (SSES) was established in 2010, intending to creating social and economic transformation in one of the most backward areas of the country around the Gondwana area of Madhya Pradesh. \n\nSant Singaji Institute of Science & Management is a co-educational institute, with around 1000 students from 150 + villages on its rolls catering to the youth of three rural districts of Madhya Pradesh presently - Dewas, Sehore, and Harda. \n\nThe Institute was started by Mr. Pranjal Dubey, who left his high profile job in SAP Labs, Bangalore to set up this institute in his native village. Pranjal Dubey comes from a family that traditionally provided the head priest for the Sant Singaji Temple at Sandalpur in Madhya Pradesh. \n\nAt his father's passing in 1996 it was his duty to take over this role, and although he returned to Sandalpur annually for the temple festival, he continued his career as a software engineer in Bengaluru with the blessing of the village elders. \n\n\nEvery time he visited he encountered desperation from parents and youth who struggled to rise above poverty, despite the education and qualifications accessible to them. On investigation, he found the education available to local youth to be substandard. It became clear that he had a mission to change this and the chain of poverty that was left behind. \n\nIn only 7 years, the organization has achieved stellar results . 15 students, 14 of them being girls have obtained University ranks, putting Sandalpur on the education map of Madhya Pradesh. \nMany of their graduates are working in companies in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Indore, Pune, etc in companies such as Cognizant, Wipro, CapGemini, SAP Labs, Infosys, etc.",

Pranjal Dubey comes from a family that traditionally provided the head priest for the Sant Singaji Temple at Sandalpur in Madhya Pradesh. \n\nAt his father's passing in 1996 it was his duty to take over this role, and although he returned to Sandalpur annually for the temple festival, he continued his career as a software engineer in Bengaluru with the blessing of the village elders. \n\n\nEvery time he visited he encountered desperation from parents and youth who struggled to rise above poverty, despite the education and qualifications accessible to them. On investigation, he found the education available to local youth to be substandard. It became clear that he had a mission to change this and the chain of poverty that was left behind. \n\nIn only 7 years, the organization has achieved stellar results . 15 students, 14 of them being girls have obtained University ranks, putting Sandalpur on the education map of Madhya Pradesh. \nMany of their graduates are working in companies in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Indore, Pune, etc in companies such as Cognizant, Wipro, CapGemini, SAP Labs, Infosys, etc.",

With more than half the country's elderly living below the poverty line, even day to day survival is crucial. \n\nWhere quality of life is concerned for these elderly, there is much left to be desired. Inadequate healthcare, minimal or no pension and a depleting source of income, often force the destitute rural elderly to continue working despite physical hardships.\n\nHelpAge India is a leading charity in India working with and for disadvantaged elderly for nearly 4 decades. HelpAge advocates for their needs such as for Universal pension, Quality healthcare, Action against Elder Abuse and many more at a national, state and societal level with Central and State governments. \n\nHelpAges focus over the years has moved from welfare to development. They provide elderly relief through various age-care interventions. \n\nThey conduct cataract surgeries to restore sight of elders, looks after their basic needs though its Support-a-Gran program, runs Elder Helplines across the country, provides relief & rehabilitation for elderly post disasters and provides active-ageing opportunities.\n\nThey run one of the largest mobile healthcare programs through its Mobile Healthcare Units. These units operate across the country providing free healthcare services to destitute elders. \n\nThey also help elders earn their livelihood through the formation of Elder-Self-Help Groups making them self-reliant.",

With more than half the country's elderly living below the poverty line, even day to day survival is crucial. \n\nWhere quality of life is concerned for these elderly, there is much left to be desired. Inadequate healthcare, minimal or no pension and a depleting source of income, often force the destitute rural elderly to continue working despite physical hardships.\n\nHelpAge India is a leading charity in India working with and for disadvantaged elderly for nearly 4 decades. HelpAge advocates for their needs such as for Universal pension, Quality healthcare, Action against Elder Abuse and many more at a national, state and societal level with Central and State governments. \n\nHelpAges focus over the years has moved from welfare to development. They provide elderly relief through various age-care interventions. \n\nThey conduct cataract surgeries to restore sight of elders, looks after their basic needs though its Support-a-Gran program, runs Elder Helplines across the country, provides relief & rehabilitation for elderly post disasters and provides active-ageing opportunities.\n\nThey run one of the largest mobile healthcare programs through its Mobile Healthcare Units. These units operate across the country providing free healthcare services to destitute elders. \n\nThey also help elders earn their livelihood through the formation of Elder-Self-Help Groups making them self-reliant.",

They brought together four more people and started a Trust named Blind Welfare Council. They decided to help the differently abled at every stage of life so that they do not face the hardships that they faced for themselves.\n\nThey wanted to ensure that the all differently abled people of Dahod and Panchmahals districts have access to equal opportunities. They wanted to provide these people a good quality of life and participation in the society that respects their rights and dignity.\n\nThe founder Yusufi Kapadia says, \"I have suffered a lot during my studies and for getting a job, being visually challenged. It is my aim that each and every child or person with disability should get equal opportunity in all fields of life and all his rights be fulfilled. He should live a life at par with any other citizen of the country. Leadership by a person with visual impairment has made a great change in the working of the staff members.\"\n\nAbout 150 students with intellectual disabilities, and about 30 students with hearing impairment are being trained for activities of daily living and primary academics since 2002. 1000 children with intellectual disabilities, hearing impairment, visual impairment are trained and educated by the special teachers. \n\nAids & appliances distributed as per the need like tricycle, wheel chair, crutches, white cane, hearing aids etc - 500\n\nSudents with intellectual disability, blindness or with locomotor disability are being trained in operating computers - 20\n\nIn 2017, Blind welfare council Dahod was awarded the International Excellence award by the Association of Rehab Professional and Allied Services & Para Sports Association Excellent Service to the differently abled.",

They wanted to provide these people a good quality of life and participation in the society that respects their rights and dignity.\n\nThe founder Yusufi Kapadia says, \"I have suffered a lot during my studies and for getting a job, being visually challenged. It is my aim that each and every child or person with disability should get equal opportunity in all fields of life and all his rights be fulfilled. He should live a life at par with any other citizen of the country. Leadership by a person with visual impairment has made a great change in the working of the staff members.\"\n\nAbout 150 students with intellectual disabilities, and about 30 students with hearing impairment are being trained for activities of daily living and primary academics since 2002. 1000 children with intellectual disabilities, hearing impairment, visual impairment are trained and educated by the special teachers. \n\nAids & appliances distributed as per the need like tricycle, wheel chair, crutches, white cane, hearing aids etc - 500\n\nSudents with intellectual disability, blindness or with locomotor disability are being trained in operating computers - 20\n\nIn 2017, Blind welfare council Dahod was awarded the International Excellence award by the Association of Rehab Professional and Allied Services & Para Sports Association Excellent Service to the differently abled.",

			"description": "Antarang envisions a world where every young person is productively, positively and passionately engaged in a vocation of their choice.\n\nPriya Agrawal and Lopa Gandhi have worked extensively with adolescents from low income settlements. The gap between education and employment was a big one to bridge - and without employment education seemed meaningless and added to the frustration of youth from these disadvantaged communities. Youth tended to drop out and meander aimlessly at the vulnerable 16 - 18 year age group. Thus was born an intervention that looked at specific career outcomes that gave purpose and direction to their lives. \n\nAntarang started with a pilot group of 20 youth from slums across Mumbai in a 6 weekend intervention. The success of that pilot and the resultant placement of >50% of youth from that group slowly led to more groups and more partnerships.\n \nPriya Agrawal has held key leadership roles in the social sector, having headed organisations like The Akanksha Foundation and SNEHA in the past.\n\nAntarang Foundation is a registered not-for-profit organisation that works with disadvantaged young adults. Through structured interventions, they motivate young people to stay in education until they are 18, after which, they train them in employability skills and place them in careers of their choice. They do this through two career focused programmes CareerAware and CareeReady.\n\nTheir CareeReady programme is a career readiness and employability skills training programme for youth in the age group of 18 - 25 years. Students undergo a well-defined regiment of development and training. The program consists of 5 key aspects spread over different sessions: Career awareness, Self-awareness, Work skills, Work ethics and Business spoken English.\n\nCareeReady groups in the communities are a mix of adolescents with different educational backgrounds - some may be school dropouts, others may be pursuing their 12th or beyond. Different techniques are used to keep the batch engaged given the inconsistent educational backgrounds. Several batches of CareerReady Programme are run simultaneously across multiple locations in Mumbai. Keeping this diversity in mind, facilitators or trainers use a 'Buddy System' which enhances learning as well as boosts confidence.\n\nRather than a one-way dialogue, all concepts are explained with the help of role plays and various activities. Students are also encouraged to work on projects in groups. They support interactive style of learning rather than a lecture/authority style of delivery. They believe in the concept of 'Do and Learn' and therefore, promote self-learning to develop critical thinking skills and retain knowledge that leads to self-actualisation. Trainers also use audio-visual aids as and when required to introduce an element of fun!\n\nThe CareerAware program\n\n\"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" is at once an exciting and terrifying question for any teenager or young adult. At this stage, it is the awareness of options, the ability to make an informed choice and the process of charting out a career path that motivates adolescents and young adults to stick to education, and set career goals. \nIn India, the Right to education ends at the age of 14, and only 1 in 2 children complete high school. The ratio of students in higher education is sadly even lower. Every school drop-out is prone to high risk behaviour, and usually end up in informal employment, characterised by low wages and no benefits.\n\nTo break this cycle, Antarang introduced the CareerAware program. The program targets students who fall in the crucial 14 - 17 years age bracket. Through intensive self awareness, career awareness and career planning sessions, CareerAware encourages teenagers to stay in education until they are 18 years old. By emphasising on the number and quality of options that become available only if they stay in education, CareerAware reinforces the importance of education in young minds.",

The main objective is to provide education to destitute, abandoned and orphaned children with good residential care through a family like environment and intellectual development and ensure a well rehabilitated citizen of the future. \n\nIndia Sponsorship Committee's vision is to have a Society in which all children without distinction of any caste, creed or gender, enjoy their rights and are empowered through education to develop to their full potential embracing values, learning to live together with faith in the human race. \u00a0\nAnd their mission is to provide children in need the support required by them for an education that offers them opportunities that develop their full potential. \u00a0\nFurther, it seeks to create opportunities for children to become responsible, contributing members of society by helping them meet their family, social, emotional, physical and spiritual needs.",

It was in this year that the country gained independence and could finally decide its own destiny, standing on its own two feet. As if in a parallel development, there was a similar thought process in the mind of Mr. Mangulal J Shah, who wanted to raise the education and skills of India's visually challenged persons ( VCP's) so high that they would no longer be dependent on others for their self sufficiency. \n\nThus the history of the National Association for the Blind, India too begins in 1947 itself. This seed was then watered for the first time in Bombay by Mr. B. G. Kher, the then Premier of Bombay Province, who moved a resolution at the First All India Conference for the Blind, and helped establish NAB, India.\n\nThe National Association for the Blind works with visually impaired people of all age groups, and runs a number of programs that range from providing Integrated education and Vocational Training to visually impaired children and adults, to designing certifiable courses and recording audio books. \n\nNAB aims to re-integrate visually impaired people into regular life, and has gone on to touch the lives of thousands of people.",

As if in a parallel development, there was a similar thought process in the mind of Mr. Mangulal J Shah, who wanted to raise the education and skills of India's visually challenged persons ( VCP's) so high that they would no longer be dependent on others for their self sufficiency. \n\nThus the history of the National Association for the Blind, India too begins in 1947 itself. This seed was then watered for the first time in Bombay by Mr. B. G. Kher, the then Premier of Bombay Province, who moved a resolution at the First All India Conference for the Blind, and helped establish NAB, India.\n\nThe National Association for the Blind works with visually impaired people of all age groups, and runs a number of programs that range from providing Integrated education and Vocational Training to visually impaired children and adults, to designing certifiable courses and recording audio books. \n\nNAB aims to re-integrate visually impaired people into regular life, and has gone on to touch the lives of thousands of people.",

The idea was to award scholarships of financial assistance to ensure that financially challenged bright students did not give up their education for want of finances.\n\nStudents attending Government schools have neither the purchasing power to buy books nor access to books. To address this problem, BREAD has set up 1024 Children's Libraries in government schools during the last 9 years in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to inculcate a habit of reading books among them. \n\nTo sustain the interest of students, 80 to 100 new books were being added to existing BREAD children's libraries once in 3 years till 2017-18. \n\nFrom 2018-19, 40 new books are added to all existing libraries annually.\n\nIn FY 16-17, 124 libraries were set up, 80 new books were added to 221 existing libraries and scholarships were given to 80 students.\n\nBasic Research Education And Development (BREAD) Society is one of the few organizations that is wholly volunteer-based and has no paid staff.",

The idea was to award scholarships of financial assistance to ensure that financially challenged bright students did not give up their education for want of finances.\n\nStudents attending Government schools have neither the purchasing power to buy books nor access to books. To address this problem, BREAD has set up 1024 Children's Libraries in government schools during the last 9 years in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to inculcate a habit of reading books among them. \n\nTo sustain the interest of students, 80 to 100 new books were being added to existing BREAD children's libraries once in 3 years till 2017-18. \n\nFrom 2018-19, 40 new books are added to all existing libraries annually.\n\nIn FY 16-17, 124 libraries were set up, 80 new books were added to 221 existing libraries and scholarships were given to 80 students.\n\nBasic Research Education And Development (BREAD) Society is one of the few organizations that is wholly volunteer-based and has no paid staff.",

Their Comprehensive Community Health Programme is active in 76 villages and adopts a unique community empowering model to expand their reach.

Prayaag Joshi, currently a teacher and an erstwhile tax advisor is the executive arm of the board of trustees. He works full time on the activities of the trust. \n\nThe three trustees work together in a spirit of camaraderie and determine the work of the trust increasingly in consultation with its many beneficiaries who are still very young people.\n\nThe trust works with individuals through collaborative initiatives in areas of education, health, livelihoods, culture and ecology especially engaging with the old, the young and women.",

They engage with Government schools, community colleges and vocational institutes, to help them adopt ICT-enabled educational solutions. \n\nFounded in 2005 as a program of the International Youth Foundation - IYF, and financially supported by the United States Agency for International Development -USAID, they help educators and educational institutions drive the use of technology in teaching and learning. \n\nThere is a significant disconnect between India's basic education system and the needs and opportunities of its emerging economy, which highlights the need for greater emphasis in linking learning with livelihoods. To bridge this gap between education and skills, Quest Alliance designs scalable and replicable solutions across four major programs to enable self-learning for young people between the ages of 10 and 35 years.",

When she was 18 years old she visited her grandparents who were in Bombay, and on that particular visit of hers, she saw the inequality in education between the private and the public schools. Vandana worked with the Boston-based non-profit organization Citizen Schools, an organization dedicated to changing the life trajectories of underprivileged children in urban areas, for four years.\n \n At Akanksha, she served on the team to create a blueprint for Teach for India, later moving on to manage the Beyond School department serving all adolescent children of Akanksha. In 2007, she became the Director of The School Project, launched to create a network of high-achieving schools within the government system. She took over as CEO in January of 2010. The Akanksha Foundation attempts to one day equip all students with the education, skills, and character they need to lead empowered lives.\n \n In 2015, The Akanksha Foundation was awarded the India NGO Award 2014/2015 by The Resource Alliance For setting and promoting best practices in resource mobilization accountability and transparency and In 2016, The Akanksha Foundation was awarded the Gold NGO Transparency Award by the GuideStar India Transparency",

When she was 18 years old she visited her grandparents who were in Bombay, and on that particular visit of hers, she saw the inequality in education between the private and the public schools. Vandana worked with the Boston-based non-profit organization Citizen Schools, an organization dedicated to changing the life trajectories of underprivileged children in urban areas, for four years.\n \n At Akanksha, she served on the team to create a blueprint for Teach for India, later moving on to manage the Beyond School department serving all adolescent children of Akanksha. In 2007, she became the Director of The School Project, launched to create a network of high-achieving schools within the government system. She took over as CEO in January of 2010. The Akanksha Foundation attempts to one day equip all students with the education, skills, and character they need to lead empowered lives.\n \n In 2015, The Akanksha Foundation was awarded the India NGO Award 2014/2015 by The Resource Alliance For setting and promoting best practices in resource mobilization accountability and transparency and In 2016, The Akanksha Foundation was awarded the Gold NGO Transparency Award by the GuideStar India Transparency",

			"description": "Kutumba was set up in 1991 when Mary Paul was on a sabbatical from Vathsalya Charitable Trust. The idea was suggested to her by one of Vathsalya's trustees as Vathasalya struggled to place differently abled kids in homes. \n\nKutumba was started as a home for boys with MR/CP. Patients were mainly referred by Spastic Society. Until 1997-98 the boys were sent to Spastic Society for vocational training. However slowly Kutumba started accepting girls but as there was an issue housing boys and girls, they started weaning of the boys. Once the last boy had left they tied up with APD to offer safe housing for the girls attending APD vocational training courses.\n\nKutumba was operating out of rented premises until 2006 they moved into their own premises. The 10000 sq.ft of land was donated by Mary's cousin and two corporate donors. I-flex solutions, Bangalore and Stichting Geron in the Netherlands came forward and donated 15 lacs each to fund the building of two cottages. \n\nIn 2007 Goldman Sachs sponsored roofing between the 2 cottages to create a sheltered space for activities. This is when Kutumba started a preschool/daycare for kids of daily wage workers (mainly construction workers). \n\nKutumba has a residential facility for differently abled young women. The ages of these young women range between 19 and 30. Most of the girls are orthopedically challenged. A few are with speech and hearing impairment. These girls are from rural parts of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh from very poor homes. All the girls attend 1-year or 2-year vocational & technical training classes at The Association of People with Disability (APD). \n\nThe beneficiaries are provided food, shelter, transport free of cost. The girls stay at Kutumba for one to three years on an average. An average of 20 girls stay, although the numbers could go up to 30 or come down to 15 depending on the period of training and admission of new residents. APD also sends short-term course trainees. These girls stay here anywhere between 2 days to 3 months. \n\nKutumba also runs a pre-school and day care (10:30 a.m. -4:00 p.m.) for young children between the ages of 2-5 years. These kids come from a nearby slum area. Most of their parents are daily wage workers or are employed as maids. During the hours that they spend at Kutumba, these children learn rhymes, numbers and play games. The teacher engages them in activities for a couple of hours in the morning. After lunch, they have rest. Parents are not charged any fees.",

Isha Home School adopts an unconventional schooling method which strives to provide a nourishing space for learning devoid of pressures. Isha Insight is the brainchild of the Isha Leadership Academy which aims at providing the highest quality of leadership education in India and explores the science of scaling up one's business as well as one's own self. \n \n All these initiatives have contributed to a wide range of social achievements from educated rural population to instilling the youth with leadership skills. These achievements accelerate the founder's vision of enhancing the boundaries of one's perception through education.",

Isha Vidya was formed to provide high-quality school education to underprivileged rural children who cannot otherwise access or afford it.\n \n With 9 schools and over 7000 students, the members of Isha Vidya actively support and promote education among female children in the villages as a result of which their schools have seen an increased enrolment of girl children. Isha Home School adopts an unconventional schooling method which strives to provide a nourishing space for learning devoid of pressures. Isha Insight is the brainchild of the Isha Leadership Academy which aims at providing the highest quality of leadership education in India and explores the science of scaling up one's business as well as one's own self. \n \n All these initiatives have contributed to a wide range of social achievements from educated rural population to instilling the youth with leadership skills. These achievements accelerate the founder's vision of enhancing the boundaries of one's perception through education.",
